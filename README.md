We mainly worked on getting object detection, using OpenVino, and lane centering to work together in Python. It was a great experience to participate in this competition and I highly recommend anyone who is able to compete to take part in it!

Unfortunetly the car did not work as expected during the competition and I cannot compete again since I will be finishing my Masters' this year in 2022. However, I wish the best of luck for my teammates if they decide to compete next year!
